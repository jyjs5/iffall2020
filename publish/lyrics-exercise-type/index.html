                    [Verse 1]</b>
            
            <p>I've been staring at the edge of the water
            'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
            I wish I could be the perfect daughter
            But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try</p>
        <br>
              <b style= "color: #9ddbf8">
                [Refrain 1]</b>
           
              <p>Every turn I take, every trail I track
            Every path I make, every road leads back
            To the place I know, where I can not go, where I long to be</p>
        <br>
                <b style= "color: #b7a7f1">
                    [Chorus 1]</b>

            <p>See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
            And no one knows, how far it goes
            If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
            One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go</p>
        <br>
                
                <b style="color: #8ac0ae">
                    [Verse 2]</b>

            <p>I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island
            Everything is by design
            I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
            So maybe I can roll with mine</p>
                
                <b style= "color:#9ddbf8">
                    [Refrain 2]</b>
           
            <p>I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
            I'll be satisfied if I play along
            But the voice inside sings a different song
            What is wrong with me?</p>
           

        <br>
                <b style= "color: #b7a7f1">
                    [Chorus 2]</b>
            
            <p>See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
            But no one knows, how deep it goes
            And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
            And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?</p>
                
                <b style= "color: #b7a7f1">
                    [Chorus 3]</b>
            
            <p>The line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
            And no one knows, how far it goes
            If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
            One day I'll know, how far I'll go</p>
